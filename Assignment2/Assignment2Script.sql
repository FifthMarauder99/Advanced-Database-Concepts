Let PC(parent : integer,child : integer) be a rooted parent- child
tree. So a pair (n, m) in ‘PC’ indicates that node n is a parent of
node m. The ‘sameGeneration(n1, n2)’ binary relation is inductively
defined using the following two rules:

(1) If n is a node in PC, then the pair (n, n) is in the
sameGeneration relation. (Base rule)

(2) If n1 is the parent of m1 in PC and n2 is the parent of m2 in PC
and (n1,n2) is a pair in the sameGeneration relation then (m1, m2) is
a pair in the sameGeneration relation. (Inductive Rule)

Write a recursive view for the sameGeneration relation. Test your
view.
